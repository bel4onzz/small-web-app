                We have a system where the companies can log in and manage their profiles. Currently,
                within the company profile, they can add a single
                email address, which is used for all communication that is sent by the system to the company.
                We have a requirement to enable the company to add multiple email addresses, so they can be used for
                different types of communication
                (marketing, billing, etc…).
                List all the changes that you think must happen to fulfill this requirement. Share any details on how
                you would approach this requirement.
                Feel free to insert any assumptions on the current implementation for the items that don’t seem clear to
                you.
